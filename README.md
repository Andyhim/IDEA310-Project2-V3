Welcome to my build for project 2!

This game follows the Unity "Creator Kit: Beginner Code" tutorial: https://learn.unity.com/project/creator-kit-beginner-code?uv=2022.3

My custom additions to the game include:

-Crude oil: an Effect Item that functions similarly to potions, gives the player a large amount of damage upon consumption

-Barrel Helmet: an Equipment Item that gives the player immense damage protection when equipped

-Large Green Cube: an extremely powerful weapon
